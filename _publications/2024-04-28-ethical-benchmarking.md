excerpt: 'Rapid advancement in the computer industry has sparked growing concerns about ethical aspects of computing. In this position paper, we explore an overlooked area: ethical dimensions of benchmarking practices in computer architecture. The selection of benchmarks embeds underlying ethical values into the final design. In light of this, we identify and discuss various shortcomings in current benchmark practices, point out their ethical implications, and make several proposals for how the computer architecture field can address them.'

excerpt: 'Machine learning (ML) has seen a major rise in popularity on edge devices in recent years, ranging from IoT devices to self-driving cars. Security in a critical consideration on these platforms. State-of-the-art security-centric ML algorithms (e.g., differentially private ML, adversarial robustness) require noise sampled from Laplace or Gaussian distributions. Edge accelerators lack CPUs to add such noise. Existing hardware approaches to generate noise on-the-fly incur high overheads and leak side-channel information that can undermine security. To remedy this, we propose DINAR, lightweight hardware that enables noise addition from arbitrary distributions. For differentially private ML, DINAR enables noise addition while incurring 23x lower area and 40x lower energy compared to producing noise directly on-chip.'

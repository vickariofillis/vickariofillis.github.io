I am Victor Kariofillis, a PhD candidate at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/). I am advised by Prof. [Natalie Enright Jerger](https://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~enright/).

<b>Research Focus</b>

My primary research lies in Computer Architecture, with a strong emphasis on innovative techniques for enhancing system performance, energy efficiency, and adaptability. I am passionate about interdisciplinary collaborations and exploring emerging technologies that could shape the future of computing.

For my PhD, I am dedicated to exploring energy-efficient mobile architectures. My research includes an extensive workload characterization of commercial mobile benchmark suites. This work contributes insights to computer architects for refining mobile benchmarking methodologies and optimizing the evaluation process. As a next step, I am interested in exploring research related to workloads used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).

During my Masterâ€™s studies, I focused on the development of Precompression, a novel technique leveraging XOR logic characteristics to enable greater last-level cache compression. This method complements existing compression techniques by reshaping data to enhance subsequent compression.

<b>Social Aspects of Computing</b>

I am deeply interested in the social aspects of computing. This includes understanding how technology impacts society and exploring ways to ensure computing advancements benefit all. My research includes ethical considerations in benchmarking practices and the potential of Brain-Computer Interfaces to enhance human-computer interaction.

<b>Career Aspirations</b>

Post-PhD, I aim to pursue a research-based career in the industry, contributing to advancements in computer architecture. I am also open to opportunities for internships and welcome industry professionals to reach out to discuss potential collaborations.
